# Integrating Computor Vision into British American Football

## Introduction
American Football in the UK (and in Europe generally) is still very 'grass roots' in which investment is small and technology is very basic. With Flag Football becoming an olympic sport in 2028, this gives the UK the opportunity to grow exponentially.

The goal with this piece of work is to build a computer vision model to automate statistics to allow analysts to focus more on trend and strategic analysis. Currently, team analysts (including myself) have a weekly task of going through clip by clip multiple times to try and see which number got that tackle, how far was that catch/ run. It can be tedious and has a risk of human error.

## Project Background 

This objective is to build the model for British American Football teams to use to moderise the way they capture player data, making it faster, more accurate and less resource intensive. The immediate challenges centre around the quality of equipment used to record games and whether a model can overcome the inconsistancies from team to team and if not, is there a solution to use if you want this model to work for you?

A second challenge is the quality of fields being played on, some are artificial, some are grass, some are 90 yards long, some are 100 etc. So its imperetive we figure out what works and what doesn't. 

I will look at current market leaders in this space such as Veo, who already have this technology available but at a price, BAFA affiliated clubs are largely if not exclusivly self-funded through player fees and some are fortunate to have sponsership and that extra expense does not pass the cost-benefit stage. The goal with this model will be to either drastically reduce that cost or make it freely available whilst ensuring we are staying within legal perameters, as this model may be used in some instances on Veo footage.
